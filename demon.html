    <h3 class="demon_footer">
        The demons in Doom are each very unique, and each serve their own purpose. You can see in the base game how the developers placed the
        demons in order to get them to work together. They are designed to be used together, and you can make incredibly damaging combinations. 
        This is probably best shown off with the Archvile, which is the most effective when surrounded by its allies. His ability to 
        resurect and push you away with its flame attack makes him really strong at the back of the line. This is but one example of how
        demons can be effectively utilized together in order to make a fun and engaging challenge. To quote Reggie Fils-Aimé, "The game is fun. 
        The game is a battle. If it's not fun, why bother? If it's not a battle, where's the fun? It's a test that you pass or a quest that you fail.
         A race against time. Fun and battle always lock together."
